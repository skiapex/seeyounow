                    <p>11.   SeeYouNow Platform and Technology. SeeYouNow exclusively owns and retains all right, title and interest in and to the Software and the SeeYouNow Platform and all software, materials, formats, designs, interfaces, information, text, data, graphics, images, video, logos, icons, audio, content, computer code, SeeYouNow’s Confidential Information, and SeeYouNow proprietary information and technology used by SeeYouNow or provided to You in connection with the SeeYouNow Platform and any compilation thereof (the “SeeYouNow Technology”). The SeeYouNow Technology is protected by intellectual property rights under the laws of Canada and other countries, including copyright and trademark laws and are owned by or licensed to SeeYouNow. “SeeYouNow Medical Ltd.,” “SeeYouNow,” the SeeYouNow logo, the SeeYouNow Platform logo, and other SeeYouNow logos and product and service names are or may be trademarks of SeeYouNow (the “SeeYouNow Marks”). Without our prior written permission, and except as solely enabled by any link as provided by us, Provider agrees not to display or use the SeeYouNow Marks, whether or not registered, in any manner. Provider must preserve all copyright, trademarks, service marks, and other proprietary notices contained in the original SeeYouNow Technology on any copy Provider makes of the SeeYouNow Technology. Other than as expressly licensed to Provider in this Agreement, no license or other rights in the SeeYouNow Technology are granted to Provider, and all such rights are hereby expressly reserved by SeeYouNow. SeeYouNow shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicenseable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate into the Software any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback provided by You, relating to the Software.</p>
                    <p>5.     FEES & PAYMENT TERMS</p>
                    <p>1.      Fees. The fees for the Software and billing requirements of SeeYouNow are set out in the Registration Confirmation (incorporated by reference in to this Agreement). The parties may, in writing, amend the fees in an amended Registration Confirmation.</p>
                    <p>2.      Recurring Billing. Provider hereby authorizes SeeYouNow to charge Provider a recurring subscription fee on the recurring term and at the then current rate for the Software set out in the Registration Confirmation, and any other charges Provider may incur in connection with the use of the Software via the agreed upon method of payment as set out in the Registration Confirmation.  In the case where SeeYouNow has an agreement with an Assigned Organization (“Assigned Organization Agreement”) under the terms of which Provider is provided access to the Software and the payment is to be made by the Assigned Organization, then the payment terms are set out in the Assigned Organization Agreement.</p>
                    <p>3.      Variance.  Provider acknowledges that the amount billed each month may vary from month to month for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers and/or changing or adding Software. Provider authorizes SeeYouNow to amend monthly billing to reflect these changes</p>
                    <p>4.      Price Changes. SeeYouNow reserves the right to adjust pricing for the Software in any manner and at any time as it may determine in its sole and absolute discretion provided that, any price changes to the Software will take effect for the next billing period described in the Registration Confirmation. Unless operating under an Assigned Organization Agreement Provider may, on notice to SeeYouNow, terminate the SeeYouNow Platform under Section 8.1.</p>
                    <p>5.      Automatic Billing.  SeeYouNow automatically processes payments and invoices for any monies owed to SeeYouNow under this agreement via the payment methods outlined in the Registration Confirmation or in any Assigned Organization Agreement.  For greater clarity, registration of the Provider’s right to access the SeeYouNow Platform will commence upon processing by SeeYouNow of the first payment owed for the first billing period, unless otherwise stipulated in a separate license agreement between SeeYouNow and an Assigned Organization.</p>
                    <p>Bill Timing.  SeeYouNow reserves the right to change the timing of SeeYouNow 's billing; in particular, as indicated below, if Provider's method of payment has not successfully settled on the day it was due as described in the Registration Confirmation.</p>
                    <p>Billing Commencement Date. In the event Provider's registration began on a day not contained in a future billing period, SeeYouNow may bill Provider on a day earlier in the applicable future billing period or such other day as SeeYouNow deems appropriate. For example, if Provider's registration started on January 1st with monthly billing periods, Provider’s next payment date is likely to be February 1st, and Provider's credit card would be billed on that date. If the day of the month does not occur every billing cycle (e.g., you subscribed on the 31st, but the next month only has 30 days), then SeeYouNow will charge for payment on the last day of the month.</p>
                    <p>Authorization. Provider hereby authorizes SeeYouNow to charge Provider (including, where applicable, Provider’s credit card) at the payment frequencies set out in the Registration Confirmation.</p>
                    <p>No Refunds. Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.  However, following any cancellation, except for cancellation for cause under Section 8.2, Provider will continue to have access to the service through the end of Provider's current billing period.</p>
                    <p>Transaction Fees.  For certain credit cards, the issuer of Provider's credit card may charge Provider a foreign transaction fee or other charges. These charges are solely the responsibility of the Provider.</p>
                    <p>No Guarantee.  Provider agrees that there is no guarantee of any fees, profit, business, or use of service by Users or amount earned by Provider under this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>6.     INDEPENDENCE</p>
                    <p>1.      Independence. Provider is independent and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of or with SeeYouNow. Provider is solely responsible for the supervision and direction of the Services provided and shall be responsible for the manner in which the Services are performed, for the method employed in doing the same and for all acts and things done in the performance of the foregoing. Nothing contained in this Agreement and the relationship created between the parties hereby shall, directly or indirectly, constitute the employees, contractors and personnel of Provider to be an employee, joint venturer, agent or servant of SeeYouNow and further, nothing herein shall operate or be construed to relieve Provider of any duties or obligations imposed upon it as an independent contractor.</p>
                    <p>2.      Tax. Provider is solely responsible for any and all tax to be paid, remitted or deducted related to the amounts Provider obtains under this Agreement using the Software and/or providing the Services. SeeYouNow is not responsible to deduct or remit any taxes on behalf of Provider for any amounts obtained by Provider as a result of the Services facilitated through this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>3.      Authority</p>
                    <p>a.      No party shall have any authority to act for the other party or to incur any obligation on behalf of the other party except as specifically provided by this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>b.
